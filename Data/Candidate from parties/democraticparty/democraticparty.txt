The Democratic Party is a political party in Myanmar (Burma), founded in 1988. It was formally registered in May 2010, with its headquarters in Pazundaung Township, Yangon.[2]

The party's chairman is U Thu Wai,[1] a former political prisoner. The party's secretaries, Mya Than Than Nu and Cho Cho Kyaw Nyein, are the daughters of U Nu (former prime minister) and Kyaw Nyein (former deputy prime minister) , all well-known Burmese political leaders in the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League.[3]

The party contested in the 2010 general election, winning 3 seats in the State and Regional Hluttaws. The party won only a single seat in the 2015 general election, out of the 52 seats it contested.[4] U Aung Shwe, the party's candidate representing Chan Aye Thar San Township for the Mandalay Region Hluttaw, won a majority of the votes, because that the candidate representing the National League for Democracy was rejected before the election.[5]
