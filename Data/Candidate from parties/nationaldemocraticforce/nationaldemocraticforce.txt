The National Democratic Force is also known as the United Democratic Front; abbreviated NDF) is a Burmese political party formed by former members of the National League for Democracy (NLD) who chose to contest the 2010 general election in Myanmar (Burma).

The NDF was among the three political parties, together with the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) and the National Unity Party (NUP-Burma), to stand in the elections on a nationwide basis.[1] NDF's adoption of the peasant bamboo hat, which is the traditional symbol of the NLD, created some controversy. After the elections, Thein Nyunt, Kyi Myint, members of the Pyithu Hluttaw, and Phone Myint Aung of the Amyotha Hluttaw split away from the party and set up the New National Democracy Party. In December 2011, another member of the Aymotha Hluttaw, Myat Nyana Soe, resigned from the party and joined to NLD.[2] After the Burmese by-elections, 2012, 2 NDF MPs Than Win and Khin Maung Win also rejoined to NLD.[3]

Party Leader Dr. Than Nyein died of liver cancer at Pinlon Hospital of Yangon on 21 May 2014.[4]

275 candidates competed under the leadership of Khin Maung Swe in 2015 General Election but no one was elected anywhere.[5]
