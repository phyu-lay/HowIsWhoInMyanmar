Tekkatho Phone Naing (Burmese: Tekkatho Phone Naing, 16 January 1930 – 2002) was a famous Burmese writer, primarily known for lovelorn stories that were most popular in the 1950s to 1970s. His "sad" stories still represent some of the best popular Burmese story writing in the postwar era.


Tekkatho Phone Naing was the pen name of Khin Maung Tint (????????????), a lifelong university professor and later Chancellor of University of Moulmein. He received a Master's degree in psychology from Columbia University. During the 1988 popular uprising against the government of Burma, he called for restraint and true democracy. The military junta forced him to retire from his position as Rector of the Institute of Education, Yangon.

He died in 2002 at the age of 72.
