Controversy
After Chinese news outlets revealed Moe Set Wine's participation in a local Burmese Chinese pageant, some pockets of Burma's social media openly criticized her ancestry, questioning her citizenship status as well as whether a native-born Burmese of Chinese ancestry could represent Burma in pageants.[9][10] A spokesperson for Hello Madam Media, which organized the 2013 Miss Universe Myanmar competition, stated that she holds Burmese citizenship, and that her parents, of Shan and Burmese descent, are from Namkham, in northern Shan State.[9]
