Tay Za (IPA: [tèza?]; Burmese: ???, pronounced [tèza?]; also spelled Tayza or Teza; born 18 July 1964) is a Burmese business tycoon and the Chairman of Htoo Group of Companies, Myanmar. He is a close associate of the country's former head of state, Than Shwe. He is the first Myanmar entrepreneur to appear on the cover of Forbes Asia.[1][2]

He was born on 18 July 1964 in Yangon. His father, Myint Swe (deceased), was a retired lieutenant colonel at the Ministry of Industry.[2] He is the youngest of six siblings. He passed 10th standard at TTC of Yangon in 1982. He attended the Defence Services Academy, as part of the 1982 intake, but dropped out during his third year to marry Thida Zaw (daughter of U Zaw and Daw Htoo of Gyobingauk), against the wishes of both families.[2]
His major business interests include Htoo Group and Air Bagan, the country's first and only fully privately owned airline.[3] In 2006–2007, Htoo Trading, a division of Htoo Holdings involved in teak log exports, was Burma's top private exporter and fifth largest overall, with gross revenues of $65.1 million.[4] He began his career in the 1980s and started Htoo Group in the early 1990s to extract timber from Burma's forests.[5]

Other activities include construction, tourism, infrastructure projects, and mobile phone services. He enters into banking business and sets up Asia Green Development Bank when a license was granted by military junta in 2010 before giving up its power after general election.[6] His bank was sanctioned by US Government soon after it was established. But it was removed from sanction list in 2013.[7]

He was an arms broker for ex-military regime, helping to buy military hardware from Russia.[8]

Tay Za's airline Air Bagan is the main sponsor of Yangon United Football Club, one of the nine professional football clubs in Myanmar competing for the Myanmar National League (MNL) title. His son is chairman of the club.
