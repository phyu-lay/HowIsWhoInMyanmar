Dr Sai Mauk Kham (Burmese: ??????????????? [sá?? ma?? k?á?]; born 1950) is a former vice president, an ethnic Shan Burmese politician and incumbent Pyithu Hluttaw MP for Lashio Township. He previously served as Vice President of Myanmar. He was elected as Second Vice President on 4 February 2011, defeating Aye Maung of the Rakhine Nationalities Development Party and receiving 84% of the votes (140 of 167 votes) in the Amyotha Hluttaw.[1][2]

Personal life and education
Born in Muse, Myanmar, he is a physician by profession, graduating from the Institute of Medicine, Mandalay (now the University of Medicine, Mandalay) in 1974. He also used to be the chairman of the Shan Literature and Culture Association.[3] He runs a private clinic and manages a private hospital in Lashio Township.[4]

Electoral fraud
In 2015 general election, Sai Mauk Kham was contested a Pyithu Hluttaw (lower house) seat in Lashio Township. There were allegations of voting fraud which pulled him forward by more than 4000 votes, where the National League for Democracy (NLD) was expected to win. The NLD, Shan Nationalities League for Democracy and Shan Nationalities Democratic Party had filed a complaint with the Union Election Commission (UEC). The UEC responded by declaring that the victory of Sai Mauk Kham was legal and that no fraud had taken place.
