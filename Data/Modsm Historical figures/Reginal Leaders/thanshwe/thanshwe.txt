Senior General Than Shwe (Burmese: ????????; pronounced [?á? ?wè]; born 2 February 1933) is a Burmese strongman politician who was the head of state of Burma from 1992 to 2011 as Chairman of the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). During this period, he held key positions of power including Prime Minister of Burma, Commander-in-chief of Myanmar Defense Services and head of the Union Solidarity and Development Association. In March 2011 he officially stepped down as head of state in favour of his hand-picked successor, Thein Sein, and as head of the Armed Forces, being replaced by general Min Aung Hlaing.
Than Shwe was born in Minzu village, near Kyaukse, British Burma in 1933 or 1935.[2] In 1949, Than Shwe attended and finished Government High School in Kyaukse. He took up employment at the Meikhtila Post Office as a postal clerk. Later he enlisted in the Burmese Army and was in the ninth intake of the Army Officer Training School.[3]
