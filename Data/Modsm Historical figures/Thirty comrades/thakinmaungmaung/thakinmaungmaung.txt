Biography
Maung Maung was the son of lawyer U Sint and his wife Daw Aye Tin. He graduated from BTN High School. He attended the fourth intake of the Japan academy. In 1946, he received the degree of Bachelor of Arts from Rangoon University. In 1949, he received a Bachelor of Law (BL) degree. He was a lecturer in the English department in Rangoon University, editor of the Burma Khit Newspaper, and Assistant Secretary of Burma Railways. In 1950, he received a scholarship to study in the UK. He entered the Lawyers' Association opened in Lincoln Guest House, Hague. He attended the international Law education school there. He received his LLD from Utrecht University in the Netherlands in June 1956. He temporarily relocated to the United States, as a visiting Lecturer in Political Science and Southeast Asian Studies at Yale University, with his family.[2] During his stay in Yale, he earned a doctorate in juridical science (JSD), on 11 June 1962.[2]

Maung had five children with his wife, Khin May Hnin (aka) Khin Myint. One of his sons, Brig-Gen Kyaw Thu (Retd.) currently holds the post of Deputy Foreign Minister on the SPDC, the governing body in Burma.[needs update] He also served in various capacities in the successive governments of Myanmar as Attorney-General, Supreme Judge-General and other positions.

Political office
Maung Maung served in a legal capacity in General Ne Win's caretaker government from 1958–1960. Following Ne Win's 1962 military coup, Maung Maung became Chief Justice and, although a civilian, was a prominent member of the central committee of the BSPP. He played a large part in shaping the 1974 constitution and subsequent changes to the judicial system. On 19 August 1988, amidst a series of large-scale demonstrations, the People's Assembly declared Maung Maung President and Chairman of the BSPP.[3][4] Anti-government demonstrations continued and widespread disruptions resulted in another military coup led by Saw Maung on 18 September 1988.[5][6] After his brief spell in power in 1988, Maung Maung disappeared from the public eye, although it was rumoured that he helped draft the election law governing the 1990 general election.[7]
